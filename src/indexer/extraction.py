"""Two-pass LLM extraction pipeline for git commit knowledge.

Each qualifying commit is processed in two passes:
  1. Structured Q&A pass: answers specific questions about the commit
  2. Free-form entity pass: extracts entities and relationships as facts

Both passes call graphiti_instance.add_episode() and tag the episodes with
source_description starting with 'git-history-index:'.

Large diffs (>300 lines) are summarized first before extraction to keep
prompt sizes manageable.
