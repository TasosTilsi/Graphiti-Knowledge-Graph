# Phase 8.8: Gap Closure — Verification Documentation — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Write missing VERIFICATION.md files for Phases 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5; update Phase 06
VERIFICATION.md from `human_needed` to `passed`; close R4.1 checkbox in REQUIREMENTS.md.
**Verified:** 2026-03-01T00:00:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Success Criteria Verification

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `.planning/phases/08.2-gap-closure-mcp-server-bugs-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` exists and documents bug fixes for --async flag, context.py bare path, _auto_install_hooks keys | VERIFIED | File exists; frontmatter `status: passed`; Observable Truths table has 5/5 entries for --async->--quiet fix (R6.3), bare path fix (R6.2), wrong keys fix (R4.2); all citing 8.2-01-SUMMARY.md and 8.2-02-SUMMARY.md |
| 2 | `.planning/phases/08.3-gap-closure-queue-dispatch-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` exists and documents BackgroundWorker._replay_command() dispatch fix | VERIFIED | File exists; frontmatter `status: passed`; Observable Truths table has 5/5 entries; cites 8.3-01-SUMMARY.md (dispatch guard at line 277, `_handle_capture_git_commits()` at line 319) and 8.3-02-SUMMARY.md (8 passing tests, `stats.dead_letter == 0`) |
| 3 | `.planning/phases/08.5-gap-closure-human-runtime-verification-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` exists and records human verification guide completion | VERIFIED | File exists; frontmatter `status: passed`; 5/5 truths verified; records both guides — 02-HUMAN-VERIFICATION.md (436 lines, 6 tests) and 06-HUMAN-VERIFICATION.md (499 lines, 5 tests) from 8.5-01-SUMMARY.md and 8.5-02-SUMMARY.md |
| 4 | `.planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md` status updated from `human_needed` to `passed` | VERIFIED | Frontmatter `status: passed` (line 4); `re_verification` block present with `previous_status: human_needed`; 4 `human_verification` entries updated with `status: passed_via_guide`; re-verification status section appended at end of file |
| 5 | REQUIREMENTS.md R4.1 checkbox changed from `[ ]` to `[x]` and traceability table shows Complete | VERIFIED | `R4.1.*Complete` matches in REQUIREMENTS.md; footer updated to `17/19 Complete`; `16/19` absent; `R4.1.*Pending` absent |

**Score:** 5/5 criteria verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/08.2-gap-closure-mcp-server-bugs-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` | status: passed, documents 3 bug fixes, covers R6.3/R6.2/R4.2 | VERIFIED | Created 2026-03-01. 5/5 truths. Requirements Coverage: R6.3 SATISFIED, R6.2 SATISFIED, R4.2 SATISFIED. Cites 8.2-01-SUMMARY.md and 8.2-02-SUMMARY.md. |
| `.planning/phases/08.3-gap-closure-queue-dispatch-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` | status: passed, documents dispatch fix, 8 tests, dead_letter==0 guard, covers R4.2/R4.3 | VERIFIED | Created 2026-03-01. 5/5 truths. Requirements Coverage: R4.2 SATISFIED, R4.3 SATISFIED. Dead letter regression guard documented. Cites 8.3-01-SUMMARY.md and 8.3-02-SUMMARY.md. |
| `.planning/phases/08.5-gap-closure-human-runtime-verification-inserted/VERIFICATION.md` | status: passed, records both human verification guides written | VERIFIED | Created 2026-03-01. 5/5 truths. Requirements Coverage: R3.1/R3.2/R3.3/R4.1/R4.2 GUIDE WRITTEN. Cites 8.5-01-SUMMARY.md and 8.5-02-SUMMARY.md. |
| `.planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md` | status changed to passed, re_verification block, evidence chain documented | VERIFIED | Frontmatter updated. `re_verification` YAML block with 4 gaps_closed entries. All human_verification items have `status: passed_via_guide`. Re-verification section appended. |
| `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | R4.1 row: Complete; footer: 17/19; no R4.1 Pending | VERIFIED | Traceability table row updated. Footer note updated from 16/19 to 17/19. R4.1 listed as closed by Phase 8.8. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| Phase 8.8 Plan 01 VERIFICATION.md files | Phase 8.2/8.3/8.5 SUMMARY.md files | evidence citation | VERIFIED | All three VERIFICATION.md files cite their respective SUMMARY.md files as primary evidence sources |
| REQUIREMENTS.md R4.1 | Phase 8.8 | traceability row | VERIFIED | `Phase 8.8: Gap Closure — Verification Documentation` appears in R4.1 traceability row |
| Phase 8.8 Plan 02 | Phase 8.5 VERIFICATION.md | R4.1 closure rationale | VERIFIED | Phase 8.5 VERIFICATION.md documents guide completion; Phase 8.8 Plan 02 uses this as basis for R4.1 formal closure |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| R4.1: Conversation-Based Capture | 8.8-02 | R4.1 formally closed — guide written (Phase 8.5), bugs fixed (Phases 8.6, 8.7), Phase 06 VERIFICATION.md status updated to passed | SATISFIED | REQUIREMENTS.md: R4.1 row shows Complete; 06-VERIFICATION.md: status: passed; 8.8-02-SUMMARY.md: documents the closure chain |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. Phase 8.8 produced documentation files only (5 VERIFICATION.md files created or updated, 1 REQUIREMENTS.md row updated, 2 SUMMARY.md files created). No code changes.

### Human Verification Required

None. All success criteria are programmatically verifiable:
- File existence: confirmed
- Frontmatter status values: confirmed by read
- R4.1 traceability: confirmed by grep

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 5 success criteria verified.

Phase 8.8 completed the verification documentation protocol:
1. 3-source cross-reference (PLAN + SUMMARY + VERIFICATION) now complete for Phases 8.2, 8.3, and 8.5
2. Phase 06 VERIFICATION.md status aligned with actual completion (evidence chain: 8.5 guide + 8.6/8.7 bug fixes + VERIFICATION-FINAL.md)
3. R4.1 formally closed in REQUIREMENTS.md: 17/19 requirements complete for milestone v1.0
