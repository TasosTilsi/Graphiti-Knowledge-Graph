# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 08-mcp-server
    provides: Phase 08 SUMMARY files (08-01 through 08-04) as evidence sources

provides:
  - .planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md
  - 3-source cross-reference verification record for Phase 08 MCP Server
  - Phase 08 v1.0 milestone audit satisfiability (PLANs + SUMMARYs + VERIFICATION present)

affects:
  - v1.0 milestone audit (Phase 08 can now be audited with all three source types)
  - Phase 8.2 (forward-references from VERIFICATION.md document which bugs are tracked there)

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "3-source cross-reference: PLANs + SUMMARYs + VERIFICATION.md are the three required audit sources"

key-decisions:
  - "Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md status is 'passed' — post-verification bug discovery does not retroactively block procedural verification"
  - "R6.2 and R6.3 declared SATISFIED with known-issue notes pointing to Phase 8.2 gap closure"
  - "08-04-SUMMARY.md used as primary evidence source (contains both automated smoke test results and human verification results)"

# Phase 8.1 Plan 02: Phase 08 MCP Server VERIFICATION.md Summary

**Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md created with 3-source cross-reference format; R6.1/R6.2/R6.3 declared SATISFIED; known-issue notes for R6.2 and R6.3 forward-tracked to Phase 8.2**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~2 min (117 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-02-24T13:45:59Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-24T13:47:56Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Created `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` following the 3-source cross-reference format established in Phase 01 (01-VERIFICATION.md)
- Synthesized evidence from all four Phase 08 SUMMARY files (08-01 through 08-04)
- Declared R6.1 SATISFIED (10/10 tools, 5/5 human-verified criteria, 5/5 smoke tests)
- Declared R6.2 and R6.3 SATISFIED with known-issue notes pointing to Phase 8.2
- Phase 08 v1.0 milestone audit now satisfiable — all three required sources present

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Write VERIFICATION.md for Phase 08 MCP Server** - `da89497` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` — 3-source cross-reference verification record with:
  - Frontmatter: `status: passed`, `known_issues` for R6.2 and R6.3
  - Observable Truths table (5/5 verified)
  - Required Artifacts table (7 files verified)
  - Key Link Verification table (5 links verified)
  - Requirements Coverage table (R6.1, R6.2, R6.3 all SATISFIED)
  - Evidence Sources table (4 SUMMARY files cited)
  - Automated Smoke Test Results (5/5 PASS from 08-04-SUMMARY.md)
  - Human Verification Results (5/5 PASS, performed 2026-02-23)
  - Known Issues section (R6.2 and R6.3 bugs, tracked in Phase 8.2)
  - Anti-Patterns Found (none)
  - Gaps Summary

## Decisions Made

- **VERIFICATION.md status is `passed`:** Post-verification bug discovery (R6.2 path bug, R6.3 --async flag) does not retroactively block Phase 08 procedural verification. All 5 human verification criteria passed at the time of verification on 2026-02-23.
- **Primary evidence source is 08-04-SUMMARY.md:** Contains both automated smoke test results (5/5) and human verification results (5/5) — the most complete evidence record for Phase 08.
- **Known-issue status `SATISFIED (issues noted)`:** Used for R6.2 and R6.3 to clearly communicate that the requirements were met procedurally while forward-tracking the specific bugs to Phase 8.2.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The file was created with the exact structure and content specified in the PLAN.md task definition.

## Verification Results

All plan verification checks passed:
