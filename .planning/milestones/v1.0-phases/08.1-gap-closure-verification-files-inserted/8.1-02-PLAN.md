<objective>
Write the VERIFICATION.md file for Phase 08 (MCP Server), synthesizing evidence from 08-04-SUMMARY.md (human verification of 5/5 criteria) into the 3-source cross-reference format required by the v1.0 milestone audit.

Purpose: Phase 08 passed human verification in Claude Code but never had a VERIFICATION.md created. Known bugs in R6.2 (context.py path) and R6.3 (--async flag) are tracked in Phase 8.2 — they must be noted in this file as "issues found, tracked in 8.2, not blocking Phase 08 procedural verification."

Output: `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` — a complete verification record declaring R6.1 satisfied, R6.2 and R6.3 satisfied with known-issue notes, citing 08-04-SUMMARY.md and other SUMMARY files as evidence.

The file MUST follow the same structure as 01-VERIFICATION.md. Use this exact schema:

# Phase 8: MCP Server Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Build MCP server with 10 tools callable from Claude Code, context injection on session start, and non-blocking conversation capture
**Verified:** 2026-02-23T21:14:04Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No - initial verification (synthesized from 08-04-SUMMARY.md on 2026-02-24)
**Verification method:** Human verification — Claude Code tool panel, context injection, and capture behavior confirmed by user on 2026-02-23. 5 automated smoke tests also pass.
**Known issues:** R6.2 and R6.3 bugs found during verification; tracked in Phase 8.2 gap closure. Not blocking Phase 08 procedural verification.
```

**Observable Truths table** — derive from 08-04-SUMMARY.md human verification results:

| 1 | All 10 graphiti_* MCP tools appear in Claude Code's tool panel after `graphiti mcp install` | VERIFIED | 08-04-SUMMARY.md human verification: "All 10 graphiti_* tools visible in tool panel after restart" |
| 2 | Context injection fires on Claude Code session start; relevant graph entities are retrieved | VERIFIED | 08-04-SUMMARY.md: "Entity seeded before restart was retrieved correctly on session start." Context resource returns content in 6ms (empty graph = silent — correct behavior) |

**Evidence Sources section:**

```
## Evidence Sources

| Source | Type | Key Evidence |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/08-04-SUMMARY.md` | Human verification summary | 5/5 human-verified criteria; 5/5 automated smoke tests; PATH bug found and fixed |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/08-03-SUMMARY.md` | Plan summary | server.py, context.py, install.py, mcp CLI commands implemented |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/08-02-SUMMARY.md` | Plan summary | 10 graphiti_* tool handlers; non-blocking Popen for capture |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/08-01-SUMMARY.md` | Plan summary | mcp[cli] 1.26.0 + python-toon 0.1.3 installed; toon_utils.py created |

**3-source cross-reference:** PLAN files (08-01 through 08-04), SUMMARY files (08-01 through 08-04), VERIFICATION (this file) — all three sources now present.
```

**Automated Smoke Test Results:**

```
## Automated Smoke Test Results (from 08-04-SUMMARY.md)

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test 1: Server starts (stdio) | PASS | Responds to `initialize` with `serverInfo.name="graphiti"`, protocol 2024-11-05 |
| Test 2: Context resource | PASS | Returns string in 6ms; empty graph = silent (correct behavior) |
| Test 3: Non-blocking capture | PASS | Returns in 0ms; RuntimeError on missing CLI is fast and actionable |
| Test 4: Error propagation | PASS | graphiti_show raises RuntimeError with actionable message |
| Test 5: SKILL.md behaviors | PASS | All 4 patterns present in 3516-char SKILL.md |

5/5 automated smoke tests pass.
```

**Human Verification Results:**

```
## Human Verification Results (from 08-04-SUMMARY.md)

Performed by user in Claude Code on 2026-02-23.

| Criterion | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tools appear in Claude Code | PASS | All 10 graphiti_* tools visible in tool panel after restart |
| Context injection | PASS | Entity seeded before restart was retrieved correctly on session start |
| Search works | PASS | graphiti_search returned results as natural prose |
| Non-blocking capture | PASS | graphiti_capture returned instantly (background Popen) |
| Error propagation | PASS | Confirmed in automated smoke tests |

5/5 human verification criteria confirmed.
```

**Known Issues section** — this is the key section distinguishing Phase 08 from Phase 01:

```
## Known Issues (Tracked in Phase 8.2)

The following bugs were discovered during or after Phase 08 verification. They are tracked in Phase 8.2 (Gap Closure — MCP Server Bugs) and do NOT retroactively block Phase 08 procedural verification — all 5 verification criteria passed at the time of human verification on 2026-02-23.

| Issue | Requirement | Phase 8.2 Plan | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| R6.3: --async flag behavior bug | R6.3: Conversation Capture Hook | 8.2 gap closure | Non-blocking |
| R6.2: context.py path resolution bug | R6.2: Context Injection Hooks | 8.2 gap closure | Non-blocking |

These issues are forward-tracked to Phase 8.2. Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md status remains `passed` — the verification protocol confirms the phase's procedural completion, not post-verification bug discovery.
```

**Anti-Patterns section:**

```
## Anti-Patterns Found

None found at time of Phase 08 verification. The PATH bug (bare "graphiti" string in _run_graphiti()) was found and fixed during 08-04 verification (commit c81aaad) before the phase was declared complete.
```

**Gaps Summary:**

```
## Gaps Summary

Phase 08 procedurally complete as of 2026-02-23. No gaps remaining within Phase 08 scope.

Post-verification bugs (R6.2 path resolution, R6.3 --async flag) are tracked as Phase 8.2 gap closure items, separate from Phase 08 verification status.

- R6.1: MCP tools callable from Claude Code — SATISFIED (10/10 tools verified)
- R6.2: Context injection — SATISFIED with known bug tracked in 8.2
- R6.3: Conversation capture — SATISFIED with known bug tracked in 8.2

Phase 8 (MCP Server) goal achieved.
