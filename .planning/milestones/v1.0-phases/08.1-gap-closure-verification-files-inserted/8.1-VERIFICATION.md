# Phase 8.1: Gap Closure — Verification Files Inserted

**Phase Goal:** Write VERIFICATION.md files for Phase 03 (LLM Integration) and Phase 08 (MCP Server) to satisfy the 3-source cross-reference protocol required by milestone audit. Evidence already exists — this phase synthesizes it into the required format.
**Verified:** 2026-02-24T14:30:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

All truths are drawn from the `must_haves` blocks in 8.1-01-PLAN.md and 8.1-02-PLAN.md.

#### Plan 8.1-01 truths (Phase 03 VERIFICATION.md — R5.1, R5.2, R5.3)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | A VERIFICATION.md exists in `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/` following the 3-source cross-reference format | VERIFIED | File exists at `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` (106 lines). Frontmatter: `status: passed`, `score: 3/3 requirements verified`. Contains Observable Truths table, Required Artifacts table, Key Link Verification table, Requirements Coverage table, Evidence Sources, UAT Test Results, and Gaps Summary sections. |
| 2 | The file cites 03-UAT.md as the primary evidence source for 19/19 passing tests | VERIFIED | `03-UAT.md` appears 8 times in the file. Primary evidence source row reads: "19/19 tests passing; covers cloud availability, failover, quota, queue, and integration scenarios." |
| 3 | Requirements R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 are each listed with SATISFIED status and linked to specific UAT test numbers | VERIFIED | Requirements Coverage table contains 3 rows, each with `SATISFIED` status. R5.1 cites "UAT tests 5, 6, 7", R5.2 cites "UAT tests 5, 15, 17", R5.3 cites "UAT test 15, integration suite". `grep -c SATISFIED` returns 3. |
| 4 | The Phase 03 audit is now satisfiable — all three required sources (PLAN, SUMMARY, VERIFICATION) exist | VERIFIED | PLANs: 03-01 through 03-05 confirmed present. SUMMARYs: 03-01 through 03-05 confirmed present. VERIFICATION: confirmed present. 3-source cross-reference explicit in file: "PLAN files (03-01 through 03-05), SUMMARY files (03-01 through 03-05), VERIFICATION (this file) — all three sources now present." |

#### Plan 8.1-02 truths (Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md — R6.1, R6.2, R6.3)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 5 | A VERIFICATION.md exists in `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/` following the 3-source cross-reference format | VERIFIED | File exists at `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` (137 lines). Frontmatter: `status: passed`, `score: 5/5 human-verified criteria; 3/3 requirements verified`. Contains all required structural sections including Known Issues section specific to this phase. |
| 6 | The file cites 08-04-SUMMARY.md as the primary evidence source (human verification 5/5 criteria) | VERIFIED | `08-04-SUMMARY.md` appears 11 times in the file. Primary evidence source row reads: "5/5 human-verified criteria; 5/5 automated smoke tests; PATH bug found and fixed." |
| 7 | R6.1 is listed with SATISFIED status; R6.2 and R6.3 are listed with SATISFIED status and known-issue notes | VERIFIED | Requirements Coverage table: R6.1 → "SATISFIED", R6.2 → "SATISFIED (issues noted)", R6.3 → "SATISFIED (issues noted)". `grep -c SATISFIED` returns 6. Frontmatter `known_issues` block lists R6.2 and R6.3 with `blocking: false`. |
| 8 | Known bugs for R6.2 and R6.3 are noted as "tracked in Phase 8.2, not blocking Phase 08 procedural verification" | VERIFIED | "8.2" appears 14 times in the file. Dedicated "Known Issues (Tracked in Phase 8.2)" section states: "do NOT retroactively block Phase 08 procedural verification". R6.2 notes "tracked in Phase 8.2" and R6.3 notes "--async flag behavior tracked in Phase 8.2" in Requirements Coverage table. |
| 9 | The Phase 08 audit is now satisfiable — all three required sources (PLANs, SUMMARYs, VERIFICATION) exist | VERIFIED | PLANs: 08-01 through 08-04 confirmed present. SUMMARYs: 08-01 through 08-04 confirmed present. VERIFICATION: confirmed present. 3-source cross-reference explicit in file: "PLAN files (08-01 through 08-04), SUMMARY files (08-01 through 08-04), VERIFICATION (this file) — all three sources now present." |

**Score:** 9/9 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` | 3-source cross-reference verification record for Phase 03 LLM Integration, containing R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 | VERIFIED | Exists. 106 lines. Frontmatter `status: passed`. Substantive: all required tables present. Committed in `da89497`. |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` | 3-source cross-reference verification record for Phase 08 MCP Server, containing R6.1, R6.2, R6.3 | VERIFIED | Exists. 137 lines. Frontmatter `status: passed` with `known_issues` block. Substantive: all required tables plus Known Issues section and Human Verification Results section. Committed in `da89497`. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` | `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/03-UAT.md` | Source citation in Evidence Sources table | VERIFIED | Pattern `03-UAT.md` found 8 times in VERIFICATION.md |
| `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` | `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/03-05-SUMMARY.md` | Source citation in Evidence Sources table | VERIFIED | Pattern `03-05-SUMMARY.md` found 2 times in VERIFICATION.md |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` | `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/08-04-SUMMARY.md` | Source citation in Evidence Sources table | VERIFIED | Pattern `08-04-SUMMARY.md` found 11 times in VERIFICATION.md |
| `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md` | Phase 8.2 | Known issues forward reference | VERIFIED | Pattern `8.2` found 14 times in VERIFICATION.md; dedicated "Known Issues (Tracked in Phase 8.2)" section present |

### Requirements Coverage

Phase 8.1 plan frontmatter declares: R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 (plan 8.1-01) and R6.1 (plan 8.1-02).

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| R5.1: Cloud Ollama Primary | 8.1-01 | Cloud Ollama used as primary LLM provider with quota tracking | SATISFIED | VERIFICATION.md row: "SATISFIED — cloud-first routing with API key + quota tracking; automatic fallback on 429" |
| R5.2: Local Ollama Fallback | 8.1-01 | Automatic fallback to local Ollama with gemma2:9b / llama3.2:3b chain | SATISFIED | VERIFICATION.md row: "SATISFIED — local fallback with gemma2:9b / llama3.2:3b chain; nomic-embed-text embeddings via OllamaEmbedder" |
| R5.3: Fallback Hierarchy | 8.1-01 | Full hierarchy: cloud → local → queue-and-raise | SATISFIED | VERIFICATION.md row: "SATISFIED — cloud → local → queue-and-raise hierarchy implemented and tested in 11 integration tests" |
| R6.1: MCP Server Tools | 8.1-02 | 10 MCP tools callable from Claude Code via stdio transport | SATISFIED | VERIFICATION.md row: "SATISFIED — 10 graphiti_* tools callable from Claude Code via stdio transport; all verified human-in-the-loop 2026-02-23" |

**Note on R6.2 and R6.3:** These requirement IDs appear in the Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md (authored by Phase 8.1) but are claimed by Phase 8.2 in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability, not by Phase 8.1. Plan 8.1-02 frontmatter declares only `requirements: [R6.1]`. Phase 8.1's role for R6.2/R6.3 is to document their known issues and forward-track them to Phase 8.2 — not to satisfy them. This is consistent: Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md marks them "SATISFIED (issues noted)" as a procedural record of Phase 08's completion, while Phase 8.2 is responsible for the actual bug fixes.

**Orphaned check:** REQUIREMENTS.md traceability maps R5.1/R5.2/R5.3 to "Phase 8.1: Gap Closure — Verification Files" with status "Complete". R6.1 is also mapped to Phase 8.1 with status "Pending" (the traceability status appears not to have been updated to "Complete" after Phase 8.1 executed, but the artifact evidence confirms satisfaction). No orphaned requirements found — all IDs in plan frontmatter are accounted for in REQUIREMENTS.md.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` line 65 | Mentions "TODO" in prose | Info | Not a code stub. Sentence reads: "`local_auto_start` config field is present but implementation deferred with documented TODO — this is intentional scope deferral, not a stub." This is accurate documentation of a known deferral in the Phase 03 implementation, not a gap in the VERIFICATION.md itself. |

No blocker anti-patterns found.

### Human Verification Required

None. Phase 8.1's goal is to produce documentation files (VERIFICATION.md records). Both files exist, are substantive, cite the correct sources, and were committed to git. Goal is fully verifiable programmatically.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 9 must-haves verified.

Both VERIFICATION.md files were created in commit `da89497` and exist on disk. The Phase 8.1 goal — inserting missing VERIFICATION.md records to satisfy the 3-source cross-reference protocol — is fully achieved:

- `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md`: R5.1/R5.2/R5.3 declared SATISFIED, 03-UAT.md cited as primary evidence (19/19 tests), 3-source cross-reference complete.
- `.planning/phases/08-mcp-server/VERIFICATION.md`: R6.1 declared SATISFIED, R6.2/R6.3 declared SATISFIED with known-issue notes tracking to Phase 8.2, 08-04-SUMMARY.md cited as primary evidence (5/5 human criteria + 5/5 smoke tests), 3-source cross-reference complete.
