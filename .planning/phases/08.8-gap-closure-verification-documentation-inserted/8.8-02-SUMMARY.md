plan: "02"
subsystem: documentation
tags: [gap-closure, requirements, r4.1, verification-status, phase-06]

requires:
  - phase: 08.8-plan-01
    provides: Phase 8.5 VERIFICATION.md with status passed — traceable basis for R4.1 closure
  - phase: 06-automatic-capture
    provides: 06-VERIFICATION.md with status human_needed requiring update to passed
  - phase: 08.5-gap-closure-human-runtime-verification-inserted
    provides: 06-HUMAN-VERIFICATION.md (499 lines, 5 tests)
  - phase: 08.6-gap-closure-runtime-bugs
    provides: LLM .name field and process_queue() race condition fixes
  - phase: 08.7-gap-closure-hook-security
    provides: scan_staged_secrets() and pre-commit hook wiring fixes

provides:
  - .planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md (status: passed, re_verification block)
  - .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md R4.1 row: Complete (was Pending)
  - .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md footer: 17/19 Complete (was 16/19)
  - R4.1 formally closed with traceable evidence chain

affects:
  - Phase 8.8 success criteria complete
  - Milestone v1.0 audit: 17/19 requirements complete

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - re-verification-block: document evidence chain for status change in YAML frontmatter

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - .planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md
    - .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

key-decisions:
  - "re_verification block used (not full re-write): only the status and evidence chain needed updating; the body of 06-VERIFICATION.md accurately describes the implementation"
  - "17/19 count: R3.3 and R6.1 remain pending (Phase 8.9 scope); R4.1 is now the 17th complete requirement"
  - "body text references to human_needed left in place: they describe the historical state and are now supplemented by the re-verification section at the end"

# Phase 8.8 Plan 02: Update Phase 06 VERIFICATION.md and Close R4.1 in REQUIREMENTS.md

**Phase 06 VERIFICATION.md status updated from human_needed to passed; R4.1 formally closed in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (17/19 complete)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-01
- **Completed:** 2026-03-01
- **Tasks:** 2 completed
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Updated `.planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md` frontmatter: `status: passed`, added `re_verification` block documenting the Phase 8.5/8.6/8.7 evidence chain, updated all four `human_verification` entries with `status: passed_via_guide` and guide references, appended re-verification status update section
- Updated `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`: R4.1 row changed from `Pending` to `Complete`, footer updated from `16/19` to `17/19 Complete`

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Update Phase 06 VERIFICATION.md status from human_needed to passed** — frontmatter update + re-verification section appended
2. **Task 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md R4.1 row to Complete and update footer count** — traceability table and status count updated

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md` — frontmatter `status: passed`; `re_verification` block with 4 gaps_closed entries; all `human_verification` entries have `status: passed_via_guide`; re-verification section appended at end
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — R4.1 row: `Pending` -> `Complete`; footer: `16/19` -> `17/19 Complete`; R4.1 removed from pending description

## Decisions Made

- The body text of 06-VERIFICATION.md (sections describing human_needed status) was left unchanged. These are historical records of what was required; the re-verification section at the end (and the frontmatter status: passed) document the current state.
- Footer note specifically names R4.1 as "closed by Phase 8.8" for traceability.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None — both edits were targeted replacements in well-defined locations.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 8.8 success criteria fully met (all 5 criteria checked)
- Phase 8.8 VERIFICATION.md can now be written by the verifier agent
- Phase 8.9 (R3.3, R6.1) is the only remaining gap-closure phase

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: `.planning/phases/06-automatic-capture/06-VERIFICATION.md` — frontmatter `status: passed`; `re_verification.previous_status: human_needed`; re-verification section at end
- FOUND: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — `R4.1.*Complete` matches; `17/19` present; `16/19` absent; `R4.1.*Pending` absent
