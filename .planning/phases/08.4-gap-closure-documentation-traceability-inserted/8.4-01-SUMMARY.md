# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 8.1-gap-closure-verification-files-inserted
    provides: Phase 03 and 08 VERIFICATION.md files — R5.1/R5.2/R5.3/R6.1 declared SATISFIED
  - phase: 8.2-gap-closure-mcp-server-bugs-inserted
    provides: R6.2, R6.3 bugs fixed — capture --async and context.py path resolved
  - phase: 8.3-gap-closure-queue-dispatch-inserted
    provides: R4.2, R4.3 queue dispatch fixed — capture_git_commits jobs dispatched correctly

provides:
  - REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table with accurate Status for all 19 v1.0 requirements
  - requirements-completed frontmatter in all 31 SUMMARY.md files across phases 01-06
  - 3-source cross-reference consistency: REQUIREMENTS.md, VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md all agree

affects:
  - Future continuations: requirement status is now machine-readable from SUMMARY.md frontmatter
  - Phase 9: Will inherit accurate 17/19 baseline with clear R4.1 pending state

key-decisions:
  - "Apply gap-closure phase reality over plan spec: R5.1/R5.2/R5.3/R6.1 marked Complete because Phase 8.1 ran before 8.4; R6.2/R6.3 and R4.2/R4.3 marked Complete because 8.2 and 8.3 ran"
  - "Add requirements-completed to all 11 Phase 04 SUMMARY.md files: all contribute to R2.1-R2.3"
  - "R4.1 remains Pending: Phase 8.5 wrote the human verification guide but human execution not yet confirmed"

patterns-established:
  - "requirements-completed frontmatter: YAML list field in SUMMARY.md declares completed requirement IDs"
  - "Traceability update cadence: Update REQUIREMENTS.md after gap closure phases complete, not before"

requirements-completed: [R1.1, R1.2, R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, R3.1, R3.2, R3.3, R4.2, R4.3, R5.1, R5.2, R5.3, R6.1, R6.2, R6.3, R8.1, R8.2]

# Phase 8.4 Plan 01: Documentation and Traceability Gap Closure Summary

**REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updated to 17/19 Complete and requirements-completed frontmatter added to all 31 SUMMARY.md files across phases 01-06**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-24T14:41:28Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-24T15:10:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 32 (1 REQUIREMENTS.md + 31 SUMMARY.md files)

## Accomplishments

- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table updated: 17/19 v1.0 requirements now show Complete status (up from 2/19)
- requirements-completed frontmatter added to all 31 SUMMARY.md files across phases 01-06 — machine-readable requirement tracking now consistent throughout the planning record
- Status footer updated from generic "Mapped to roadmap phases" to "17/19 Complete — R4.1 pending human runtime verification"
- Phase gap closure state reflected accurately: R5.1-5.3, R6.1 from Phase 8.1; R6.2-6.3 from Phase 8.2; R4.2-4.3 from Phase 8.3

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table** - `b1c63e2` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Add requirements-completed frontmatter to phases 01-06 SUMMARY.md files** - `d7aac45` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — Traceability table: 17 Complete, 1 Pending (R4.1), 9 Phase 9 Pending; Last Updated 2026-02-24
- 31 SUMMARY.md files across phases 01-06 — Each file now has `requirements-completed: [...]` listing the requirement IDs it satisfied

## Decisions Made

**Gap closure phase reality over plan spec:**
The plan was written before phases 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 ran. The plan specified R5.1-5.3 and R6.1 as Pending (awaiting Phase 8.1), and R6.2-6.3 and R4.2-4.3 as Pending (awaiting 8.2 and 8.3). Since all three dependency phases had already run before this plan executed, those requirements were correctly marked Complete.

**All 11 Phase 04 SUMMARY.md files get requirements-completed:**
The plan's `files_modified` listed only 04-01, but the task description said to check all SUMMARY files in Phase 04. Since all 11 plans together implement R2.1 (Core Operations), R2.2 (Config), and R2.3 (Health), all 11 files were annotated.

**R4.1 stays Pending:**
Phase 8.5 wrote the human verification guide for Phase 02 security filtering but Phase 8.5-02 addressed conversation capture (R4.1). The guide provides the test checklist but human runtime execution hasn't been confirmed, so R4.1 correctly stays Pending.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed as written, with the practical deviation that actual post-gap-closure state (all 8.1/8.2/8.3 phases done) meant more requirements were marked Complete than the plan anticipated.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Documentation traceability is now fully consistent across all three sources (REQUIREMENTS.md, VERIFICATION.md files, SUMMARY.md frontmatter)
- R4.1 (Conversation-Based Capture) awaits human runtime confirmation from Phase 8.5 guide
- Phase 9 (Advanced Features) can proceed with accurate 17/19 baseline established
