requires:
  - phase: 03-llm-integration
    provides: UAT.md with 19/19 passing tests; SUMMARY files 03-01 through 03-05

provides:
  - 3-source cross-reference verification record for Phase 03 LLM Integration
  - R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 formally declared SATISFIED with evidence citations
  - Phase 03 v1.0 milestone audit satisfiable (PLANs + SUMMARYs + VERIFICATION now all present)

affects:
  - v1.0 milestone audit
  - REQUIREMENTS.md traceability for R5.1, R5.2, R5.3
  - Phase 8.4 documentation traceability audit

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - synthesized-verification: VERIFICATION.md created retroactively from UAT.md + SUMMARY files

key-decisions:
  - "Synthesize Phase 03 VERIFICATION.md from UAT.md (primary evidence) and SUMMARY files rather than re-running tests — evidence is sufficient for retrospective verification"
  - "Use verified timestamp 2026-02-07T02:09:00Z matching UAT.md updated field for accurate historical record"
  - "3-source cross-reference format: PLANs + SUMMARYs + VERIFICATION now all present for Phase 03"

# Phase 8.1 Plan 01: Write Phase 03 LLM Integration VERIFICATION.md Summary

**3-source cross-reference VERIFICATION.md created for Phase 03 LLM Integration, declaring R5.1/R5.2/R5.3 SATISFIED with evidence from 03-UAT.md (19/19 tests) and Phase 03 SUMMARY files**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-24T13:45:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-24T13:51:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1 completed
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Created `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` following the 3-source cross-reference format from `01-VERIFICATION.md`
- Declared R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 each SATISFIED with specific UAT test number citations
- Cited 03-UAT.md as primary evidence source (19/19 tests passing) plus three SUMMARY files
- Phase 03 v1.0 milestone audit is now satisfiable — all three required sources (PLANs, SUMMARYs, VERIFICATION) exist

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Write VERIFICATION.md for Phase 03 LLM Integration** - `da89497` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/03-llm-integration/VERIFICATION.md` — 3-source cross-reference verification record: observable truths table (3 rows), required artifacts table (11 rows), key link verification table (5 rows), requirements coverage table (R5.1/R5.2/R5.3 SATISFIED), evidence sources, UAT results, gaps summary

## Decisions Made

- Synthesize verification from UAT.md + SUMMARY files rather than re-running tests (evidence complete, retroactive verification appropriate for gap closure)
- Use `2026-02-07T02:09:00Z` as verified timestamp (matches UAT.md `updated` field for accurate historical record)

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. The VERIFICATION.md content was fully specified in the plan; execution was write-only with no discovery needed.

**Note on commit `da89497`:** The Phase 03 VERIFICATION.md was committed together with the Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md in commit `da89497`, which was labeled "docs(8.1-02): write Phase 08 MCP Server VERIFICATION.md". This plan (8.1-01) claims `da89497` as its task commit for the Phase 03 artifact. Plan 8.1-02 will reference the same commit for the Phase 08 artifact.

## Issues Encountered

None — file creation was straightforward. The `.planning/` directory is gitignored; `git add -f` is required for all planning files (consistent with project convention).

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 03 audit record complete — VERIFICATION.md exists with R5.1/R5.2/R5.3 declared SATISFIED
- Ready for Plan 8.1-02 (Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md — already committed in `da89497`)
- After Phase 8.1 complete: R5.x and R6.x requirements formally traceable in VERIFICATION records
