## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CLI-first architecture: CLI provides single source of truth, hooks and MCP wrap it
- Kuzu instead of in-memory: Better persistence, performance, and graph query capabilities
- Cloud Ollama with local fallback: Free tier for most operations, local models when quota exhausted
- Separate global + per-project graphs: Global preferences apply everywhere, project knowledge isolated
- Background async capture: Never blocks dev work, queues locally and processes in background
- Path configuration using Path.home(): Cross-platform compatibility for global database location
- GraphScope enum pattern: Type-safe routing between global and project scopes
