# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** Context continuity without repetition - Claude remembers your preferences, decisions, and project architecture across all sessions without you stating them again, while project teams can share knowledge safely through git.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Storage Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- CLI-first architecture: CLI provides single source of truth, hooks and MCP wrap it
- Kuzu instead of in-memory: Better persistence, performance, and graph query capabilities
- Cloud Ollama with local fallback: Free tier for most operations, local models when quota exhausted
- Separate global + per-project graphs: Global preferences apply everywhere, project knowledge isolated
- Background async capture: Never blocks dev work, queues locally and processes in background
- Path configuration using Path.home(): Cross-platform compatibility for global database location
- GraphScope enum pattern: Type-safe routing between global and project scopes
- .git directory detection for project roots: Standard git convention, reliable across platforms
- Singleton pattern per scope: Prevents multiple Database objects to same Kuzu path
- asyncio.run() for async cleanup: Wraps KuzuDriver.close() for synchronous API
